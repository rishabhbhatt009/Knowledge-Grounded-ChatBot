### LLMs
- "GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners" by Tom B. Brown et al. This paper presents the GPT-3 model, which is a large language model trained on a diverse set of internet text. The paper shows that the model can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, question-answering, and text completion, with impressive accuracy.
- "Zero-shot Learning with Semantic Output Codes" by Kyunghyun Cho et al. This paper describes how large language models such as GPT-3 can be used for zero-shot learning, where a model can learn to perform a task without any training data. The paper shows that GPT-3 can be used to perform several zero-shot learning tasks, such as image classification and text classification.
- "GPT-3 and the Future of AI Language Models" by Ben Dickson. This article discusses the potential applications of large language models such as GPT-3 in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and education. The article also discusses the ethical concerns associated with the use of these models.
- "GPT-3: Language Models as Cognitive Tools" by Kenneth Stanley et al. This paper argues that large language models such as GPT-3 can be used as cognitive tools to help humans think more effectively. The paper suggests that these models can be used to generate novel ideas and solutions to complex problems.
- "Towards a Theory of Intelligence Based on Hierarchical Structure in Large Language Models" by Sam Ritter et al. This paper proposes a theory of intelligence based on the hierarchical structure of large language models such as GPT-3. The paper argues that the ability of these models to generate coherent and meaningful text is evidence of a hierarchical structure that mirrors the structure of human intelligence.

### QnA Chatbots
- "DialoGPT: Large-Scale Generative Pre-training for Conversational Response Generation" by Yizhe Zhang et al. This paper describes the DialoGPT model, which is a large-scale LLM trained on a diverse set of internet text for the purpose of generating natural and coherent responses in a conversational setting. The paper shows that DialoGPT can outperform previous models on several metrics, including response quality and diversity.
- "BERT for Question Answering: Fine Tuning or What Else?" by Vladimir V. Kulagin et al. This paper explores the use of the BERT model, which is another large language model, for question answering. The paper shows that fine-tuning the BERT model on a specific QnA task can lead to improved performance, but also suggests that other techniques, such as multi-task learning and ensemble methods, can be effective.
- "Leveraging Pre-trained Language Models for Question Answering on Medical Text" by Hua Xu et al. This paper explores the use of LLMs for question answering in the medical domain, which presents unique challenges due to the specialized vocabulary and complex syntax used in medical text. The paper shows that fine-tuning LLMs on medical QnA tasks can lead to significant improvements in performance.
- "Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer" by Colin Raffel et al. This paper describes the T5 model, which is a large-scale LLM designed to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including question answering. The paper shows that fine-tuning T5 on specific QnA tasks can lead to state-of-the-art performance, and also explores the use of unsupervised pre-training for QnA.

### Knowledge Grounded Chatbots
"Generating Informative Responses with Controlled Sentence Function in Knowledge-grounded Conversations" by Jiawei Wu et al. This paper presents a knowledge-grounded chatbot model that generates informative responses to user queries by controlling the sentence function of the generated response. The chatbot model is trained on a large-scale conversational dataset and a knowledge graph.

"Towards Personalized Conversational Agents: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Linqi Zhou et al. This paper proposes a personalized conversational agent that uses reinforcement learning to optimize its responses based on user feedback. The chatbot model is grounded in knowledge from a structured knowledge base and can generate informative responses tailored to the user's interests.

"Open Domain Question Answering using Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing" by Arvind Neelakantan et al. This paper presents a knowledge-grounded question-answering system that uses a combination of natural language processing and knowledge graphs to generate responses to user queries. The chatbot model is trained on a large-scale dataset of questions and answers and can generate accurate and informative responses.

"A Knowledge-grounded Neural Conversation Model" by Marjan Ghazvininejad et al. This paper proposes a knowledge-grounded chatbot model that integrates a knowledge graph into the conversation generation process. The chatbot model is trained on a large-scale conversational dataset and a knowledge graph, and can generate informative and coherent responses to user queries.

"Knowledge-grounded Dialogue Generation with Pre-trained Language Models" by Qian Chen et al. This paper presents a knowledge-grounded chatbot model that leverages pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT-2 to generate informative and relevant responses to user queries. The chatbot model is trained on a large-scale conversational dataset and a knowledge graph and can generate responses that are grounded in external knowledge sources.
