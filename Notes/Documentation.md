# Documentation Final Project

## Ideas 
1. Knowledge graph combined with a Large language model 
2. Generating Knowledge graphs using a large scale language model 
3. Multi modal knowledge graphs 
4. ==Chat GPT can not be trusted==. However we can ground it by using domain specific knowledge and make it deployable. 

Applications : 
1. multi modal KG for GPT as a domain specific task (wikiHow)
2. GPT as a Teacher : How to learn a library ?
